## About This Project
This project is free to use. Feel free to explore the code and use it in your own projects!

This bot was quickly made for my own Discord channel so I could play my local music files directly from a folder. It‚Äôs a simple solution that works for my needs, but it‚Äôs **not fully polished or feature-complete**. For example:
- It lacks proper **previous/next song** functionality.
- It has some **minimal issues**, but they don‚Äôt bother me for my personal use.

I won‚Äôt be developing this bot further, but feel free to edit the code and improve it as you like! I just wanted to bring something **VERY EASY** to the table so people can enjoy a quick and simple way to play local music in their Discord servers.
